## This app

was created with [ShinyApps](https://shinyapps.io/), using data from 
 [European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/)

Value indices are based on [Schwartz theory of basic values](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dc49/e27d0ed890cd3ed2e80ca0b0107207f12a64.pdf). They were computed following [ESS EduNet](http://essedunet.nsd.uib.no/cms/topics/1/) instructions, and weighted with design weight (post-stratification weights are not available for round 9 so far). 

<!-- 
post-stratification weight [pspweight](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/ess_methodology/data_processing_archiving/weighting.html).
-->

Data on Russia in round 7 are taken from ESS website and Russia round 9 from CESSI website. 

<!-- 
pspweight is assigned 1 to all the respondents. 
-->
