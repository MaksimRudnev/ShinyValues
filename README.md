# Basic values in Europe

A Shiny App that demontrates means of basic values measured with [Schwartz (2001)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022101032005001) scale in [European Social Survey](https://europeansocialsurvey.org).

To run, type in the RStudio console: `shiny::runGitHub("ShinyValues", "maksimrudnev")`
You might need to install some of the following packages to enable the app properly running on your device: *devtools, shiny, ggplot2, ggrepel, reshape2, stringr, maps, sf, readr*.

<!-- install.packages(c("devtools", "shiny", "ggplot2", "ggrepel", "reshape2", "stringr", "maps", "sf", "readr")) -->

The tool is purely exploratory, donâ€™t forget about comparability and measurement invariance problems.
